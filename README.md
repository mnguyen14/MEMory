## Description
MEMory is an online journal app that allows you to create journal entries, view them, and give you the option to delete them.

## Installation
Run 'npm install' in your terminal

Installation is not necessary, you can use the Heroku link provided above.

## Usage

Open the heroku link above in the readme.

Upon opening the page, you will be greeted with the login page.

If you're a returning user you can input your email and password and click on the "Log In" button to access the site. If you're a new user, to sign up, click on "Sign up" under the "Log In" button.

Enter the necessary credentials to create an account. You will not have to worry about anyone getting your password, it is hashed. When you're done click "Sign up now". 

You will then be sent the homepage where you can create a new journal entry or view or delete old entries.

For now it isn't working, but in future development we when you click on one of the entries in the entry history, the entry will appear and you will be able to read it. You will also have the option to delete it.

Upon clicking "+ New Entry" you will be sent to a page where you can create a new entry:

A title and text inside the text box is required to submit the journal entry. You are free to write about whatever you want! If you're unsure what to write about, you can select one of our sample prompts via clicking on the drop down menu.

After submitting the journal entry, it will load into your "Entry History" on the homepage where you can view or delete it.

Though the links do not work on our website, we were still able to get our app working on Insomnia. You can sign up, log in, and create, view, and delete entries.

After logging in you can create an entry.

You can see that the entry is made and it belongs to user_id: 4, Dan.

When doing a GET on a user, you can see the user's name, email, and their entries. It shows the entry title, text, and the date it was created.
